# AoPS-Keyboard-Shortcuts-Script
I'll add new shortcuts at user request, PM me casi on artofproblemsolving.com/community.

Install the script here[https://github.com/casithepython/AoPS-Keyboard-Shortcuts-Script/raw/master/aopskss.user.js]. You must have Greasemonkey, Violentmonkey, or Tampermonkey installed first. Alternately, copy-paste the aopskss.user.js code into a new userscript.
